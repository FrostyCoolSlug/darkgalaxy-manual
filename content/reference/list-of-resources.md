## Metal

Accumulated on your planets by building metal producing structures. Used to construct all buildings and units in the game.

## Mineral

Accumulated on your planets by building mineral producing structures. Used to construct all buildings and units in the game.

## Energy

Accumulated on your planets by building energy producing structures. Consumed by structures, scanning, holo-ships.

## Ground space

Each planet will have a finite amount of ground space available. Once all space has been used you will not be able to construct further land-requiring buildings until reclaiming more space with [Land Reclamation](list-of-structures.md#land-reclamation).

## Orbital space

Each planet will have a finite amount of orbital space available. Once all space has been used you will not be able to construct further orbit-requiring buildings until reclaiming more space with [Orbital Clearing](list-of-structures.md#orbital-clearing).

## Research points

Research points are spent on technological advances, and are accumulated one point per turn across your whole empire.
