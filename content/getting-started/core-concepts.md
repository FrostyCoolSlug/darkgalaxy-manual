## Game format
Dark Galaxy is a turn-based strategy game - that means turns update synchronously for all players over a fixed period of time. During a turn update, all queues will progress, resources totals will be updated, ships will move and battles will be had.

* A `standard` round consists of ~2600 turns, with each turn lasting `1 hour`. This ends up with a round length of ~3 months.
* A `speed` round usually consists of ~3000 turns, with each turn lasting `1 minute`. This format produces a round length of 2-3 days.

Once the round is over, there is usually a brief cool-off period before the next round starts. The exact times above are subject to change at the discretion of the game admin. It has been known for some rounds to go on much longer than the above.

Due to the relatively slow progress of the game, you don't need to log in every hour to keep an eye on your empire, as creating ships and buildings can take anything from 2 - 48 hours, although you might want to occasionally keep an eye on your [Radar](/content/interface-gameplay/planets/communications/radar.md), to ensure no one is approaching your planets!

## Your Home Planet
Planets are things you need to expand your empire. Many of them exist in the [Universe](/content/getting-started/universe.md), all ripe for colonisation or invasion!

When you first login to Dark Galaxy you'll start the game on your home planet, which is a safe space and cannot be travelled to, or attacked, by any other player. This planet is here to allow you to get a feel for the game, and give you somewhere safe in the event you run into problems elsewhere in the universe.

Your planet will produce [resources](/content/reference/list-of-resources.md), which you can then choose to spend on buildings, ships or soldiers.

Your home world will come equipped with a single Outpost Ship which can be used to immediately begin colonising the universe, all you need to do is create a fleet from your planets Ship Yard, transfer the outpost into it, and send it out into the unknown.


## Resources
There are 3 main [resource types](/content/reference/list-of-resources.md) in the game.

* ![Metal][metal] Metal
* ![Mineral][mineral] Mineral
* ![Energy][energy] Energy

In general ![Metal][metal] Metal and ![Mineral][mineral] Mineral are the most important, and will be what you spend when [building structures](/content/interface-gameplay/planets/building.md) and [ships](/content/interface-gameplay/planets/ship-yard.md), ![Energy][energy] Energy is required to power structures, perform scans, or create Holographic Ships.


## The Ship Yard
Once you have all the required structures, you'll build ships to visit other planets. The four ship types are:

* Combat/war ships
* Transport ships
* [Colonisation](/content/getting-started/colonisation.md) ships
* [Invasion](/content/getting-started/invasion.md) ships

See the full [ship list](/content/reference/list-of-ships.md) for full details of each ship type.


## Training
On each planet where you have constructed a Barracks, you'll have access to [train soldiers](/content/interface-gameplay/planets/barracks.md). Soldiers can be used to defend your planets and invade the planets of others.


## Research
Each tick your empire will produce 1 Research Point. This is a flat amount and does not increase with empire size.

Once you have accrued enough points you can choose to spend them to advance your empire. For full details of all research options please see the [Tech Tree](/content/reference/tech-tree.md).
